:>To configure Cypress tests to run on at least two different browsers (e.g., Chrome and Firefox):

>Install Cypress browser launchers for Chrome and Firefox using npm or yarn.
>Modify your Cypress configuration file (usually "cypress.json") to include the browser configurations for both Chrome and Firefox.
>Run your Cypress tests using the "cypress run" command, and Cypress will execute the tests in both Chrome and Firefox based on the specified configurations.


:>Document your testing approach, including the test cases, and any challenges faced during testing.
Testing Approach:
1> Valid Credentials - Successful Login:

>Enter valid username and password.
>Click the "Login" button.

2>Invalid Credentials - Invalid Username:

>Enter a valid password.
>Enter an invalid username.
>Click the "Login" button.

3>Invalid Credentials - Invalid Password:

>Enter a valid username.
>Enter an invalid password.
>Click the "Login" button.

4>Invalid Credentials - Both Username and Password Invalid:

>Enter an invalid username.
>Enter an invalid password.
>Click the "Login" button.

5>Empty Fields - No Input Provided:

>Leave both username and password fields empty.
>Click the "Login" button.
>Verify that an appropriate error message is displayed, indicating that both fields are required.

6>Empty Fields - Only Username Provided:

>Enter a valid username.
>Leave the password field empty.
>Click the "Login" button.
>Verify that an appropriate error message is displayed, indicating that the password field is required.

7>Empty Fields - Only Password Provided:

>Enter a valid password.
>Leave the username field empty.
>Click the "Login" button.
>Verify that an appropriate error message is displayed, indicating that the username field is required.

8> Validate Dashboard
>Enter a valid password.
>Leave the username field empty.
>Click the "Login" button.
>Verify Dashboard


**>Challenges faced during testing
:>Testing Stateful Behavior: Testing scenarios like session management, remembering the user after login, and handling concurrent logins can be complex and require careful scripting.
:>UI Changes: Frequent UI changes can lead to test script maintenance challenges, as you may need to update your test scripts to match the updated UI elements.
:>Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensuring consistent behavior and appearance across different browsers can be challenging, as each browser may interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript differently.
